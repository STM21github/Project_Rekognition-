AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): Services used to securely control access to aws resources, conrtols authentication(who) and authorization(what they can do).
                                        -> It has four main tabs: user, user group, role(similar to user but doesnt have credentials,passwords and can be assigned                                                temporarily
                                        -> User, user grp and roles defines the 'who'/authentication and policies defines the 'authorization'
                                        -> Policies needs to be create on basis of effect, action, resource and condition, needs to attach them also.
